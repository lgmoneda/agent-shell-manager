# agent-shell-manager

(fully vibe-coded) buffer manager for [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) that provides a tabulated list view of all open agent-shell buffers with real-time status monitoring and management capabilities.

## Features

- **Tabulated List View**: View all agent-shell buffers in an organized table.
  - Default visible columns: Buffer, Status, Mode, Model, Annotation, Last Command
  - Optional columns: Pending Permissions and Path
  - Current status (Ready, Working, Waiting, Starting..., No Session, Killed, Unknown)
  - Annotation for each shell session (useful when multiple shells share a project)
  - Last `/command` used in each shell (for example, `/help` or `/compact`)
  - macOS notification when an agent transitions from Working to Ready
  

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Auto-refreshes every 2 seconds to show current agent status

- **Process Management**:
  - Kill agent-shell processes
  - Restart agent-shells with the same configuration
  - Create new agent-shell instances
  - Delete all killed buffers at once

- **Session Control**:
  - Set session modes
  - Cycle through available session modes
  - Interrupt running agents
  
- **Debugging Tools**:
  - View traffic logs for any agent
  - Toggle ACP logging

- **Smart Display**:
  - Killed processes are displayed at the bottom in red
  - Status-based color coding for easy visual scanning
  - Customizable window placement (left, right, top, bottom, or
    user-controlled)

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) installed
2. Place `agent-shell-manager.el` in your Emacs load path
3. Add to your Emacs configuration:

```elisp
(require 'agent-shell-manager)
```

## Usage

### Opening the Manager

```elisp
M-x agent-shell-manager-toggle
```

This command toggles the visibility of the agent-shell buffer manager. By default, it appears at the bottom of the frame.

### Annotating Sessions

Use `M-x agent-shell-manager-set-annotation` in either an `agent-shell` buffer or on a row in the manager. Enter a label like `Investigating auth bug`; submit empty text to clear it.

Annotations are shown in the manager table and, by default, beside the buffer name in the `agent-shell` mode line. Long annotations are truncated to 36 columns, with the full text available on hover. Buffer names are left unchanged because `agent-shell` uses them in parts of its session and event display logic.

The display width can be changed without affecting the stored annotation:

```elisp
(setq agent-shell-manager-mode-line-annotation-width 48)
```

If you still want annotated buffer names, opt in explicitly:

```elisp
(setq agent-shell-manager-rename-buffers-with-annotation t)
```

### Key Bindings

Once the manager buffer is open, you can use these keys:

| Key         | Action                                    |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `RET`       | Switch to agent-shell buffer at point    |
| `g`         | Refresh buffer list                       |
| `k`         | Kill agent-shell process                  |
| `c`         | Create new agent-shell                    |
| `r`         | Restart agent-shell                       |
| `d`         | Delete all killed buffers                 |
| `m`         | Set session mode                          |
| `M`         | Set session model                         |
| `C-c C-c`   | Interrupt agent                           |
| `t`         | View traffic logs                         |
| `l`         | Toggle logging                            |
| `w`         | Set annotation                            |
| `v`         | Move manager to compact side window       |
| `V`         | Restore default manager window            |
| `q`         | Quit manager window                       |

## Configuration

### Visible Columns

Choose and order columns shown in the manager table:

```elisp
(setq agent-shell-manager-visible-columns
      '(provider buffer status mode model annotation last-command))
```

Available columns are: `buffer`, `provider`, `status`, `mode`, `model`,
`pending-permissions`, `annotation`, `path`, and `last-command`.

### Ready Notifications (macOS)

When enabled, a macOS notification is sent when an agent transitions from **Working** to **Ready**.

Notifications are emitted only when either:
- Emacs is not the active app, or
- Emacs is active and the completed agent buffer is not currently selected.

Keeping the manager visible does not suppress notifications. An unseen completion is
shown as **Done** until you visit its agent buffer, then returns to **Ready**.

```elisp
(setq agent-shell-manager-ready-status-notifications t)
```

To include the default macOS notification sound:

```elisp
(setq agent-shell-manager-ready-status-notification-sound t)
```

You can also toggle notifications interactively with:

```elisp
M-x agent-shell-manager-toggle-ready-status-notifications
```

And toggle notification sound interactively with:

```elisp
M-x agent-shell-manager-toggle-ready-status-notification-sound
```

### Window Position

Customize where the manager window appears:

```elisp
;; Options: 'left, 'right, 'top, 'bottom, or nil
(setq agent-shell-manager-side 'bottom)
```

When set to `nil`, the package defers to your `display-buffer-alist`
configuration and window management frameworks (such as shackle,
popper.el, etc.), giving you full control over window placement:

```elisp
;; Use dedicated window with user-controlled placement
(setq agent-shell-manager-side nil)
```

## Status Indicators

The manager displays the following status values with color coding:

- **Ready** (green): Agent is fully operational and waiting for your input
- **Working** (yellow): Agent is actively processing your request
- **Waiting** (blue): Agent is waiting for user input or permission approval
- **Starting...** (gray): Agent is initializing and starting up
- **No Session** (gray): Agent process is running but no conversation session has been established
- **Killed** (red): Process has been terminated
- **Unknown** (gray): Status cannot be determined (should not occur normally)

## Requirements

- Emacs 25.1 or later
- [agent-shell](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) package
- `tabulated-list` mode (built-in)
